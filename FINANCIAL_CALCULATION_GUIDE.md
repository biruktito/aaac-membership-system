# Financial Calculation Guide for AAAC Membership System

## üßÆ **Simplified Financial Calculation System**

### **Overview**
The financial calculation system has been simplified to provide clear, accurate, and easy-to-understand calculations for member balances and dues.

### **Key Principles**

1. **Current Date Based**: All calculations are based on the actual current date
2. **Monthly Accumulation**: Dues accumulate monthly from the member's first payment date
3. **Clear Status Categories**: Members are categorized based on months behind
4. **Transparent Calculations**: All calculations are logged for verification

## üìä **Calculation Logic**

### **1. Total Due Calculation**
```
Total Due = Monthly Fee √ó Number of Months from First Payment to Current Month
```

**Example:**
- Member started in March 2023
- Current date: August 2025
- Months from March 2023 to August 2025: 30 months
- Total Due = $15 √ó 30 = $450

### **2. Current Balance Calculation**
```
Current Balance = Total Paid - Total Due
```

**Example:**
- Total Paid: $300
- Total Due: $450
- Current Balance = $300 - $450 = -$150 (owes $150)

### **3. Months Behind Calculation**
```
Months Behind = Current Month - Last Payment Month
```

**Example:**
- Last payment: April 2025
- Current month: August 2025
- Months behind = 4 months

## üè∑Ô∏è **Member Status Categories**

| Status | Months Behind | Description | Action Required |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| ‚úÖ Current | 0-5 months | Up to date or slightly behind | Monitor |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues | 6-11 months | Behind on payments | Send reminders |
| ‚ùå Risk | 12-23 months | Significantly behind | Urgent follow-up |
| üö® Risk of Removal | 24+ months | Very behind | Consider removal |
| üö´ Inactive | 36+ months | No recent activity | Inactive status |

## üìÖ **Monthly Due Dates**

### **Automatic Monthly Accumulation**
- **August 1st**: July dues become overdue
- **September 1st**: August dues become overdue
- **October 1st**: September dues become overdue
- And so on...

### **Example Timeline**
```
Member: Biruk Tito (ID: 24)
Last Payment: April 2025
Current Date: August 2025

August 1st: Owes May, June, July (3 months = $45)
September 1st: Owes May, June, July, August (4 months = $60)
October 1st: Owes May, June, July, August, September (5 months = $75)
```
